_Last updated: 2025-10-11_

Welcome to **MyReminder** (“**Service**”, “**we**”, “**our**”, “**us**”). These Terms of Use (“**Terms**”) govern your access to and use of the Service, including our websites, apps, APIs, and related features. By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.

If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

## 1. Eligibility & Accounts
- You must be at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction to create an account and use the Service.
- You are responsible for all activity under your account and for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials (including any 2FA, backup codes).
- You must provide accurate information (e.g., a valid email) and keep it updated.

## 2. Acceptable Use
You agree not to, and not to allow others to:
- Break the law or violate these Terms.
- Upload, post, or transmit content that is illegal, harmful, infringing, or abusive.
- Attempt to access another user’s account or data.
- Interfere with or disrupt the Service (e.g., DDoS, automated scraping beyond what we permit).
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or circumvent security or technical limitations.
- Use the Service for high-risk activities where failure could lead to death or personal injury.

We may investigate and take action (including suspension or termination) for violations.

## 3. User Content
- You retain ownership of content you create or upload (e.g., countdowns, notes, folder names, aliases).
- You grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, process, and display your content solely to provide and improve the Service.
- You represent that you have all rights needed for the content you add and that your content does not violate the rights of others.
- We may remove content that we reasonably believe violates these Terms or the law.

## 4. Subscriptions & Billing
- Paid plans (e.g., Monthly/Yearly) are billed via our payment processor (e.g., Stripe). Pricing and available plans are shown in the product UI and checkout.
- By subscribing, you authorize recurring charges until canceled. Unless otherwise stated, subscriptions auto-renew for the same term at the then-current price.
- You can manage or cancel through the billing portal. If you cancel, access continues until the end of the current billing period (no partial refunds unless required by law).
- Trials and promotions may be offered and are subject to their stated terms. We may change plan features, pricing, and availability from time to time with notice as required.

## 5. ICS/WebCal & Integrations
- The Service may generate ICS/WebCal feeds and support third-party integrations (e.g., Google sign-in). You’re responsible for sharing any links or tokens securely.
- Third-party services are governed by their own terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third-party services.

## 6. Security
- We take reasonable measures to protect the Service, but no system is perfectly secure.
- You must keep your account secure (e.g., enable 2FA, manage sessions, revoke access you don’t recognize). Tell us promptly if you suspect unauthorized use.

## 7. Privacy
- Our collection and use of personal data are described in our Privacy Policy (link in the app/site). Please review it to understand how we handle your data.

## 8. Intellectual Property
- The Service, including software, design, and trademarks, is owned by us or our licensors. Except for rights expressly granted, we reserve all rights.

## 9. Changes to the Service
- We may modify, suspend, or discontinue features at any time. If a change materially impacts paid subscribers, we will provide notice as required by law and your jurisdiction.

## 10. Disclaimers
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR UNINTERRUPTED.

## 11. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER WE NOR OUR AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, OR LICENSORS ARE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR USE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US, IF ANY, FOR THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.

Some jurisdictions don’t allow certain limitations; those limits apply to the maximum allowed by law.

## 12. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your use of the Service, your content, or your violation of these Terms or the law.

## 13. Termination
