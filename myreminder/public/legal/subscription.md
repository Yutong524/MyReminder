# Subscription Policy

_Last updated: 2025-10-12_

Thank you for using **MyReminder**. This Subscription Policy explains how paid subscriptions work for our service, including billing, renewals, changes, and cancellations. By starting a paid plan, you agree to this policy in addition to our [Terms of Use](/legal/terms).

## Plans

We offer two paid plans:
- **Monthly** — billed every month.
- **Yearly** — billed every 12 months (discounted vs. monthly).

A free tier is available with limited features. Paid plans unlock additional capabilities such as:
- **Unlimited folders** and **team sharing** (Viewer / Editor / Owner).
- **Read-only public links** for folders, with **expiry** and optional **password**.
- **Epic Application** apply for epic to make your countdown known by more people.
- **Calendar subscriptions (ICS/WebCal)** export for moments and folders.

The exact feature set may evolve. Any changes that remove core functionality from your active paid plan will be announced in advance or accompanied by alternatives.

## Billing & Payments

All payments are processed by **Stripe**. Prices and currency are shown at checkout. Your subscription begins when your first payment is successfully processed.

- **Auto-Renewal**: Subscriptions renew automatically at the end of each billing period unless you cancel at period end in the billing portal.
- **Taxes**: Prices may exclude applicable taxes (e.g., VAT/GST). Stripe will add these where required by law.
- **Receipts**: Stripe will email a receipt for each successful charge.

## Trial (If Offered)

From time to time we may run promotions that include a free trial. If a trial is offered at sign-up:
- You will not be charged until the trial ends.
- If you do not cancel before the trial ends, the subscription converts to a paid plan and the first charge occurs automatically.

If no trial is offered during your sign-up, this section does not apply.

## Changes to Plan (Upgrades / Downgrades)

You can change between **Monthly** and **Yearly** via the **billing portal**. When switching:
- **Proration**: Stripe applies proration where applicable. A partial credit or charge may appear on your next invoice to reflect time already used.
- **Effective Date**: Plan changes generally take effect immediately after confirmation in the portal, unless the portal UI indicates otherwise.

## Cancellations

You can cancel at period end any time from the **billing portal**:
- **Access Until Period End**: After you set “cancel at period end,” you retain paid features until the current billing cycle ends.
- **After Expiration**: When the period ends, the subscription lapses and your account reverts to the free tier. Public links remain subject to their folder-level settings (e.g., expiry/password). If a feature requires a paid plan, access may be limited or disabled.

To avoid accidental loss of access, we recommend exporting any needed data or enabling alternatives (e.g., keeping ICS links in your calendar) before the end date.

## Refunds

Except where required by law, **payments are non-refundable**. Because you can cancel at period end at any time and many plan changes are prorated by Stripe, we do not provide partial refunds for unused time within a billing period.

If you believe a charge was made in error (e.g., fraud or duplicate), please contact support promptly with your email and invoice details.

## Failed Payments & Dunning

If Stripe cannot process your payment:
- Stripe may retry the charge automatically and send you a notice to update your payment method.
- If payment remains unsuccessful after retries, your subscription may be paused or downgraded to the free tier. You can resume service by updating your payment method in the billing portal.

## Price Changes

We may change pricing from time to time:
- Changes apply to **new** subscriptions immediately.
- For **existing** subscriptions, we will provide reasonable prior notice. If you do not agree with the new price, you can cancel at period end before the change takes effect.

## Fair Use & Abuse

We strive to provide reliable service for everyone. We may enforce reasonable **fair-use** limits to prevent abuse (e.g., excessive automated scraping of public links, spam invites, or extreme export frequency). If your usage materially impacts service stability or security, we may throttle, restrict specific features, or contact you to find an appropriate plan.

## Account Security

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and enabling **2FA** if desired. If you suspect unauthorized access, please revoke sessions from your account settings and contact support.

## Public Links (Read-Only)

Folder owners (or members with **Owner** role) can enable read-only public links with:
- **Expiry** (a date/time after which the link stops working)
- **Optional password** (folder must be accessed with the correct password)

Treat public links like any shared URL. Anyone with the URL (and password, if set) can access the read-only contents. We may log link configuration events for security purposes.

## Data Exports (ICS/WebCal)

Paid plans can export calendars via ICS/WebCal feeds. Depending on your calendar app:
- Subscriptions refresh periodically (the frequency depends on the client).
- Disabling or expiring a link in MyReminder stops further updates from that feed.

## Support

- **Free tier**: Community-level support and documentation.
- **Paid plans**: Priority email support. Response times may vary by volume and region.

## Contact

If you have questions about this policy or charges on your account, please contact us at:
- **Email**: inspirexyt@gmail.com
- **Billing Portal**: Use the "Open Billing Portal" link in your Account → Subscription section.
